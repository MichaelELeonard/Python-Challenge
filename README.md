# Python-Challenge

##### PyBank Python code - https://github.com/MichaelELeonard/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/main.py
##### PyPoll Python code - - https://github.com/MichaelELeonard/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/main.py


## GOAL
For the Module #3 Challenge we were tasked with creating Python code to manage two potential real-world situations involving a banking institution and a small rural town modernizing its election processes. 

### PyBank Project
For the PyBank project we needed the read in data from a .csv file and create code that will determine: <br>
* The total number of months included in the dataset <br>
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period <br>
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes <br>
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period <br>
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period <br>

### FINANCIAL RESULTS

For the PyPoll project we needed the read in the initial data from a .csv file and create code that will determine:

* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
