# Python-Challenge

## PyBank Project

#### PyBank Python code - https://github.com/MichaelELeonard/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/main.py

In the PyBank Challenge we were tasked with creating a python script to analyze the financial records of our company. We were provided a financial dataset called budget_data.csv composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses" and were asked to calculate each of the following values:

<br>
* The total number of months included in the dataset <br>
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period <br>
* The average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period <br>
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period <br>
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period <br>

## PyPoll Project

#### PyPoll Python code - - https://github.com/MichaelELeonard/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/main.py

In the PyPoll Challenge, we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.  We were provided a set of poll data called election_data.csv which is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
